                        <h4>Education</h4>
                        <p> I first saw how a chalkboard looked like in a school called Moi Primary School- Kabarak. From there I jumped from one school to another, 7 schools to be specific, beefore completing my KCPE in a school in Kapsabet called St. Mathews. From there I moved on to High School at Kabarak. Im currently at moringa School studying to become a software developer.</p>
                        <h4>Job?</h4>
                        <p>I am a freelance web designer in a mission to create some of the most out standing websites meant to lurw in customers. Hope I get to work with you one day.</p>
